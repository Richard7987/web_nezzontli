## Hi <Twemoji emoji="wave" /> I'm Alejandro Bernal

Welcome to **Nezzontli**, my professional portfolio. This site is more than just a collection of projects — it’s a living journal of my creative and technical journey, a space where ideas, learning, and vision come together.

### Why *Nezzontli*?

Inspired by Nahuatl, the ancestral language of the Indigenous peoples of Mexico, *Nezzontli* is an artistic interpretation that means **“my path”**.  
I chose this name because it represents exactly what I want to share here: the unique journey I’m building — through every line of code, every insight, and every creative experiment.

I'm passionate about technology <Twemoji emoji="robot" />, artificial intelligence <Twemoji emoji="brain" />, robotics <Twemoji emoji="mechanical arm" />, and audiovisual production <Twemoji emoji="clapper board" />.  
I love blending logic and artistic expression to solve real problems and create meaningful experiences.

My background and projects sit at the intersection of technology, art, and practical solutions. In this space, you'll find everything from intelligent systems and full-stack development to experimental projects exploring new ways of interaction and design.

When I’m not coding, I’m exploring new ideas <Twemoji emoji="sparkles" />, constantly learning <Twemoji emoji="books" />, and expressing myself through music and film <Twemoji emoji="film frames" />.

I’m building my path — **Nezzontli** — and this site is an open invitation to walk it with me.
