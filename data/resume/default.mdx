# Alejandro Bernal Estrada

Physics Undergraduate & Creative Software Engineer — Mexico

## Summary

I’m a self-driven software engineer and physics undergraduate with a strong passion for ethical technology, artificial intelligence, and open-source development. My work lives at the intersection of systems thinking, human creativity, and automation. With hands-on experience building intelligent applications, full-stack platforms, and self-hosted infrastructure, I enjoy crafting meaningful solutions that are both elegant and empowering.

Skilled in Python, JavaScript, GoLang, and TypeScript, I develop scalable backend systems, interactive UIs, and AI-enhanced tools. I’ve worked with LLMs (open-source and proprietary), embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Arduino), and DevOps ecosystems to build secure, modular, and privacy-aware systems. I’m also passionate about personal knowledge management, self-hosted services, and using technology to empower communities.

I'm currently working on autonomous systems for digital infrastructure, AI agents, and modular smart environments — combining code, sensors, and creativity.
